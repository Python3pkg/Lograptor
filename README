LOGRAPTOR
----------
Lograptor is a new search tool for logs written in legacy BSD syslog format
(RFC 3164) and for the IETF syslog protocol specified by RFC 5424.

It was written with the idea to have a compact and highly configurable CLI tool
for analysis and reporting of logs. Lograptor is derived from ideas and partly 
from the code of Epylog, mixed with other code written in the past for parsing 
email servers logs.

The program can perform searches in syslog files like as the UNIX command 
"grep", but with the addition of some filters and parameters, usefuls to 
restrict the search field and retrieve the relevant informations from log 
files. You should specify parameters like hostname, applications, date, 
timerange, plus a set of filters on message data. 

Lograptor can also produce reports and publish them it in a directory or send 
them by e-mail. The report may be a general or a specific report taylored for 
some accounts/hosts. With cron you could run Lograptor to produce general 
reports, similarly as you can do with Epylog.

Lograptor log analysis is based on application or device that originated the 
message, using a set of rules for matching and a rule set for report composition.

This is only an initial version of Lograptor. Please send feedbacks for bugs, 
feature requests, suggestions and comments/criticism.

Very special thanks to Konstantin ("Icon") Ryabitsev, the author
of Epylog package. The code of epylog was used in Lograptor mainly 
as a base for report and publishing modules.

Thanks also to Harco Kuppens for terminal size functions:

  /etc/lograptor/conf.d/               Directory for application configurations

For more info about main configuration file please see "man lograptor.conf". 
For each application a configuration file is needed. Logs of unconfigured 
applications are simply ignored by the program. For more info please see 
"man lograptor-apps".
