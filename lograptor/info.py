LONG_DESCRIPTION =\
"""Lograptor is a syslog parser and searching tool which provides a
command-line interface for manually or automated logs processing.
Instant pattern matchings are joinable with a set of common filters
and date/time range scope delimitation. Each search can also produce
a report that can be easily e-mailed or saved in a file system directory.
