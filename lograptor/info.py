LONG_DESCRIPTION =\
"""Lograptor is a tool which provides a command-line interface for system logs processing.

Pattern matching's searches can be performed together with filtering
rules and scope delimitation options. Each run can produce data and
a report that can be easily sent by e-mail or saved into a file system
directory.
The program can parse logs written in RFC 3164 and RFC 5424 formats.
Lograptor require Python >= 2.7, and is provided with a base configuration for a set
of well known applications. You can easily extend this set adding new applications
with specific pattern search rules.
